# E-commerce Full Stack Project, Pleigns

Welcome to Pleigns! To visit my website, please go to [https://pleigns-api.onrender.com](https://pleigns-api.onrender.com).

This project is a full-stack application incorporating a RESTful API that I built to interact with the client.


## Authentication
I used Passport.js for user authentication. A user can create an account, sign in, add items to their cart, place an order by entering card information, and even delete a placed order.

## Database
I used PostgreSQL to build my database as it is what I'm most familiar with, and I consider it a key strength of mine. I ensured to create tables with different types of relationships, such as many-to-many and one-to-many.

This design allows me to efficiently and easily add and reference data from other tables.


## Hosting
I used Render to host the app. My server and API are hosted as a web service, and the frontend is hosted as a static website. The static site makes HTTP calls to my server, which returns the necessary responses.


## Code Architecture
Regarding code architecture, I chose the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern. I wanted to challenge myself by using something new to me. I learned a lot to implement this pattern and ensure seamless communication between the view and the server.
