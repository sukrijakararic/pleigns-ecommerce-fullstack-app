# e-commerce Full Stack Project, Pleigns

Welcome to Pleigns! If you would like to visit my website, please go to 

This project is a full-stack app incorporating a restfull api that i built to interact with the client.


## Authentication
I used Passport.js for my user authentication. A User is able to make an account, sign in, add items to thier cart, as well as place an order by inputing card information and even deleting the placed order.

## Database

I used PostgreSQL to make my database. Its what I'm most familiar with and I think its a key-strength of mine. I made sure to make tables that are connected with defferent types of relationships such as many to many, and one to many.

This allowed me to add data and referece data from other tables efficiently and easily.


## Hosting
To host the app, I used Render. I hosted my server and API as a webservice and my frontend as a static website. The static site makes http calls to my server and my server serves the necessary responses.


## Code Architecture

As far as code architecture goes, I chose the MVC (model, view, controller) design pattern. I wanted to challenge myself and use something that was new to me. I learned a lot in order to implement and have the view talk to the server without any hiccups.
